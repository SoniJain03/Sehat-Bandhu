3 ML models inculcated in the project 

1. Disease Prediction with symptoms as input

2. Hospital recommendations that are nearby with patient's location, convenience and medical issue as input. 

3. Text Based(Malyalam/English) problem/medical issue analysis (translation and prediction of disease)

The Machine Learning algorithms used in the above models and their preprocessing etc have been clearly documented in the uploaded pdf (ML Documentation for Sehat Bandhu)
